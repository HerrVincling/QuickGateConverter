# QuickGateConverter

To use this script you need to download the latest version of python 3.X: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**WARNING:** This script will change ALL Normal Logic Gates to Quick Logic Gates (in the specific blueprint)

Also important:

1. Make sure that the blueprint is in the same folder as QuickGateConverter.py

2. The blueprint HAS to named "blueprint.json" (that's the default name)
